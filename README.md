# A Bytes Journey Through Kafka

This is a PDF version of the slides and notes which help to tell the story of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/).  It was given as part of an internal conference put on by [Cerner Engineering](https://engineering.cerner.com/).  


Talk Abstract:

Apache Kafka has quickly become the a integral part of Cerner’s data processing pipelines and industry standard streaming architectures. Kafka is often quickly described as a pub-sub system or distributed queue. While it can be used to fill those needs there significant differences that make it so that those terms do not adequately describe its architecture or differentiate if from similar systems.

As a significant distributed system, developer’s can often be deceived by Kafka’s getting started guide, quickly making assumptions that lead to poor performance or inaccurate results.  Digging into the details of Kafka will help developers getting started know about the important decisions to make and the effect of those decisions.

Told in the style of a children’s picture book, illustrating the story of a byte traveling through Kafka from producer to broker to consumer and all of the steps in between will help to explain the ins and out f Kafka.  The byte’s life story in Kafka will also help operators understand their options for maintaining a healthy Kafka cluster.
